              <p class="desc">
                If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
                negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
                excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
                binding arbitration. You understand that without this provision,
                you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
                The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
                Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's
                Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
                Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American
                Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and
                your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the
                AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
                Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator
                to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
                The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
                will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
                statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
                arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
                challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
                otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
                law, the arbitration will take place in Bexar, Texas. Except as
                otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to
                compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
                confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                by the arbitrator.
              </p>

              <p class="desc">
                If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
                arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
                state and federal courts located in Bexar, Texas, and the
                Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
                personal jurisdiction, and forum non convenience with respect to
                venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.

                arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
                shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
